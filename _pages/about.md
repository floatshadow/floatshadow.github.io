# About
I am Siyuan Zhu, an undergraduate student studying computer science at [Turing Honors Class, Zhejiang University](http://www.en.cs.zju.edu.cn/turing_honors_class/list.htm).
I am expected to graduate in 2024.

My research interests include compiler optimization, runtime system and verification. 
I am also exploring LLVM middle-end passes recently.

Here is my [CV](../files/siyuan_cv_en.pdf)
